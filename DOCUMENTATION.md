# üìö Auto Replacer ‚Äî Documentation

Auto Replacer is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to automatically replace text inside your notes using custom **regex patterns** and **JavaScript transform functions**.

It is designed to be **powerful**, **flexible**, and **extensible**, letting you define formatting rules and apply them in real time as you type.

---

## üîß Features

-   Custom regex-based matching
-   Dynamic placeholders like `{{file.basename}}`, `{{editor.cursor}}`, etc.
-   Real-time transformations using JS functions
-   Visual rule management UI
-   Safe-by-default: doesn't modify anything unless a match is triggered
-   Supports multiple rules, descriptions, and custom flags

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. You define a **rule** with:

    - A **name**
    - A **unique ID**
    - A **regex pattern**
    - Optional **flags** (defaults to `g`)
    - A **JavaScript function** to transform each match

2. The plugin listens for `editor-change` events.
3. On change, the entire note is normalized, all rules are tested, and any matches are replaced using your transform code.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating a Rule

The rule form includes:

| Field                      | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rule Name**              | A descriptive name (used in the UI)                        |
| **Rule ID**                | Unique identifier, lowercase only (`a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`) |
| **Regex Pattern**          | Regex pattern without slashes. Supports groups.            |
| **Regex Flags**            | Default is `g`, but you can use any combination            |
| **Replacement Code**       | JavaScript function receiving `(match, editor, file)`      |
| **Description (Optional)** | Freeform text to explain the rule‚Äôs purpose                |

### Example Replacement Function

```js
function(match, editor, file) {
  return `**${match.original.toUpperCase()}**`
}
```

### Example Dynamic Regex

```text
(?<!\*\*)\b{{file.basename}}\b(?!\*\*)
```

You can use dynamic references inside regex with double curly braces, like:

-   `{{file.basename}}`
-   `{{editor.lineCount()}}`

No escaping is needed. Just write it as-is.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Limitations
### üõë Only Run Code You Understand
The Auto Replacer plugin allows you to write and execute custom JavaScript functions to dynamically transform matched content within your notes. These functions are executed locally, directly in your Obsidian vault, and are never transmitted anywhere.

However, executing arbitrary code ‚Äî even if it looks innocent ‚Äî can have unintended consequences. You have full control over what the plugin runs, which also means you take full responsibility for what it does. A simple typo can break your notes. A badly written loop can slow down your editor. And a malicious snippet (if ever copied from somewhere) could do far worse.

So please ‚Äî only run code that you fully understand.

Auto Replacer offers you the power to automate and enhance your note-taking...
But as a certain wise uncle once said:

> With great power comes great responsibility.

### üåÄ Infinite Loops

Avoid rules that re-trigger themselves or interfere with other rules. Example of bad setup:

-   Rule A replaces "Narym" with "**Narym**"
-   But Rule B matches "**Narym**" and wants to re-format it

This can cause an **infinite loop** of updates. Always test your rules thoroughly.

### ‚ùó JS Errors

Malformed replacement code will be silently caught, but can break the replacement logic. Always test your functions in the browser devtools first.

## üí° Examples

### 1. Highlight Note Title

**Regex Pattern:**

```text
(?<!\*\*)\b{{file.basename}}\b(?!\*\*)
```

**Function:**

```js
function(match, editor, file) {
  const noteName = file?.basename;
  if (!noteName) return match.original;
  return `**${noteName}**`
}
```

### 2. Emphasize Units

**Regex Pattern:**

```text
(\d+)\s*(km|m|km\/h|m\/s)
```

**Function:**

```js
function(match) {
  const [_, number, unit] = match.match;
  return `*${number} ${unit.toLowerCase()}*`;
}
```

## üê¢ Performance Notes

We have tested:

-   Files with over **5 million characters**
-   A regex with **85k+ occurrences** across the file
-   Result: **No issues** when words are spread out

However:

> If the same word (e.g., `"foo"`) is **repeated consecutively hundreds of times**, like `foo foo foo ...`, performance may degrade.

This appears to be linked to how many elements are **rendered simultaneously** on screen, not total matches.

### Recommendation:

‚úÖ Use rules with clear boundaries
‚ùå Avoid mass repetition of a single word side-by-side

---

## üß† Under the Hood

-   Uses a **normalized** version of the text for pattern matching (stripped diacritics)
-   Applies changes using `editor.transaction()`
-   Keeps caret stable using `offsetToPos()` and `posToOffset()`
-   Dynamic paths like `{{file.extension}}` are resolved at runtime

---

## ‚úÖ Compatibility

-   Obsidian v1.8.10+
-   Should work across all major OSs
-   Compatible with community themes (uses minimal styling)
