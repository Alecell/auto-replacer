# 🪄 Auto Replacer – Obsidian Plugin

Auto Replacer is a powerful plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that automatically replaces text in your notes based on custom rules using **regex** and **JavaScript**.

Whether you want to format units, emphasize keywords, or inject smart context-aware replacements (like the note title), Auto Replacer gives you full control over text automation inside your vault.

---

## 📦 Features

-   👀 Define your own **Regex patterns**
-   🧠 Write **JavaScript transform functions** to control how matches are replaced
-   💾 Rules are **saved and editable** via a visual UI
-   🚫 Automatically avoids infinite loops or redundant replacements
-   ✨ No need to edit markdown manually or click on a button, just type and Auto Replacer will do the rest

---

## 🛠️ How it Works

Each rule consists of:

1. **Regex Pattern** – What you want to match (e.g., `\bkm\b`)
2. **Transform Function** – How to replace it (e.g., `*kilometers*`)
3. **Trigger** – Runs automatically on editor change, with debounce to prevent performance issues

Example:

```js
// Match the note title and make it bold
function transformNoteTitle(occurrence, editor, file) {
	const noteName = file?.basename;
	if (!noteName) return occurrence.original;
	return `**${noteName}**`;
}
```

## 📋 Example Rules

| Name                  | Pattern                                  | Replace With         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Replace Note Title    | `(?<!\*\*)\b{{file.basename}}\b(?!\*\*)` | `**NoteName**`       |
| Bold Narym            | `(?<!\*\*)\bnarym\b(?!\*\*)`             | `**Narym**`          |
| Strike Temperature    | `\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?\s\*(?:°C\|C\|celsius)\b`| eg: `~~26°C~~`       |
| Emphasize Measurement | `\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?\s\*(?:km\|mi\|kg\|g\|m)\b` | eg: `*49km*` |
| Fix Double Spaces     | ` {2,}`                                  | `' '` (single space) |

## 📘 How to Use

1. Open **Settings → Auto Replacer**
2. Click "Add Custom Rule"
3. Fill out:

    - `Rule Name`
    - `Rule ID`
    - `Regex Pattern` and Flags
    - `Replacement Code` (in JavaScript)
    - `Description` (optional)

4. Save and type in any note — the rule applies automatically

---

## 🧠 Advanced Usage

-   You can reference `editor` and `file` objects inside your transform code
-   Use `{{file.basename}}` as a dynamic variable in regex patterns
-   Debounce is automatically applied on `editor-change` for performance

---

## 🚨 Limitations & Considerations

-   Avoid writing transform functions that return unchanged text since it may cause unnecessary loops
-   Despite the fact that I tested it with book-size notes without problems, it also have a concern when we have too many patterns found on the same file without reasonable gaps between them, but since the word _hobbit_ is mentioned only 400 times on LOtR I _think_ it'll not be a problem.
